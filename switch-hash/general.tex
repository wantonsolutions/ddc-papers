\section{Abstract}

How to design disaggregated data structures is an open problem. This document
studies design decisions which may improve hash table performance.

\section{Introduction}

Far memory data structures are difficult to work with, especially when the
structures are shared by many processes. Obtaining serialization of operations
can be expensive and slow when using only one sided operations. The issue is
that when operations conflict clients need to retry their failed operations.
This requires multiple round trips, and often reads and writes. Ideally
operations can succeed in the common cases, and when conflicts do occur they can
be cleaned up later. Our model of disaggregation is at the level of a single
rack, where all of the machines are connected by a programmable switch. The
switch has a perfect view of all the racks traffic and can modify the traffic in
flight.

\section{Existing Hash Tables}

Clover~\cite{clover} and RACE~\cite{race}, are the only hash tables designed
specifically with disaggregation in mind. Clover supports read and write
operations on keys, writes append to a linked list, the tail of the list is the
keys current address for reads. Clover is lockless, but does not readily support
inserts and deletes at the rate that it supports reads and writes. RACE supports
inserts, deletes, reads and writes, but it does so at significant costs to the
application.

\textbf{load balancing:} Race uses power of 2 hashing on inserts. It selects the
location which has the lowest load. While this prevents load imbalance, reads
need to read two indexes rather than one. Further concurrent inserts are not
safe by their description if two concurrent writes occur and land in different
hash buckets one must be deleted. This requires an additional read after each write.

\textbf{Space:} Race uses associative hashing for each bucket. Each key can
therefore land in at most 16 locations. This fact prevents inserts from failing
in the common case, however on reads all 16 slots must be read.

\textbf{CAS size:} CAS operations are 64 bits. Therefore all race atomic entries
are pinned to 64 bit size. 48 bits of the 64 are used as an address offset, the
other 16 are used half for the size of the key, and the other half is used as a
hash of the key. THis means that writes can only take place in 255 sizes, and
that we cannot verify that the key is correct until the data is read from the
hash table. Ideally we could ensure that hash entry is correct with a single lookup.

\textbf{Self Verifying Data:} Clover ensure reads are valid by inspecting a null
pointer at the end of the write chain. In race the head pointer must be read,
and then the data must be traversed too for each read. This means that in RACE
all lookups require two round trips.

\section{Potential Extensions}:

size. A switch can track entries per bucket with a counter. Therefore the number
of buckets corresponds to the size of required switch memory. The depth of the
buckets is dependent on the size of host memory.}

\caption{Concurrent operations on a concurrent list. In the first operation a client
issues a successful CAS of the entry size to allocate it's location and size. In
the second operation another client attempts the same operation with a different
length, and the operation fails as the allocation has already been made. The
third image shows three concurrent operations. First the client which allocated
with it's CAS in operation 1 proceeds to write into it's allocated buffer. The
client from the second operation re-issules its CAS at a distance of LEN from
it's last attempt, this time succeeding in it's allocation of size LEN\_2. At the
same time a client attempts a read. The read is of size len + the CAS size. The
read must be larger than the entry to tell if it's reading the tail. Here the
read fails for 2 reasons. First the read was incomplete on the first entry
because the write was partially complete, the CRC calculation will fail on the
client. Second the client sees that the following entry has been allocated, and
it has not read enough to determine if the following entry is valid. In the
final example, the write for the second entry is partially completed by the
second writer. The reader reissues a read of size {LEN + LEN\_2 + CAS}. This time
the reader reads the entire first entry, and the second. It sees that the first
is completed, and the second is incomplete, with no following write. In this
case the reader sees the first entry as the valid value for this entry.}

Ideally a hash table index will accept inserts fast, and be quick to look up. To
achieve this we propose a hash table with deep buckets, that contain sequential
elements. A hash table with 4 buckets \textit{00, 01, 10, 11} can hold an
arbitrary number of entries. Each bucket can be allocated to an arbitrary
location in remote memory they need not be sequential. However each bucket must
have a large segment of sequential memory allocated to it.

\textbf{Insert} When an insert occurs a client first allocates a buffer in
remote memory for keys write values. Then it inserts a pointer to the buffer in
the index. The key is hashed, and is placed in the bucket with the same prefix.
If the bucket already has an entry, the insert appends the entry to the bucket.
The insert contains a pointer to the buffer, and key information. The index
value may be larger than 64 bits.

\textbf{Append Consistency} Inserts to the index are append only and occur in
multiple stages. The first state is \textit{tail allocate}. Appends run by
executing a CAS operation to the current tail of the list. If the CAS succeeds
that index is successfully allocated for the insert. The cas operation consists
of a 64 bit pointer to the write buffer.

\textbf{CAS as allocate} The CAS operation acts an an allocate operation. The
index can be any set size, as long as it is pre determined by the clients. This
allows the index to contain the full key, and any other helpful metadata about
the structure. Note that the entire index can not be written by a single CAS, it
is filled in afterwards by a write issued by the inserting client. The CAS
merely marks that the insert has occurred. If a CAS'd but not written index is
read by a client the client can choose to traverse to the write to discover what
the key is, wait for the write to complete, or pass over the index. Failed
writes can be garbage collected later. Index writes include a CRC so that write
can be verified complete. This is similar to how pilaf allows for reads of
incomplete data~\cite{pilaf}.

\textbf{Conflicting Inserts} When performing an insert the client must first
read the index to determine if a conflicting entry exists. The order of
operations is that the client hashes it's key, reads the index. If the index
exists, the insert is terminated. If the key does not exist the insert is
appended to the bucket. If two inserts occur at the same time, for instance if
an allocate occurs, but they key is not yet written, and another client runs an
insert after the partially written one, the lowest index of the key is always
taken buy subsequent reads and the following key is eventually garbage collected.

\textbf{Potentails for Programable switches} This hash structure is designed for
read and write steering. Because the number of buckets can be easily less than
the number of entries a switch must only track the index counter for each bucket
which may be far less than the total number of keys. Further if each bucket has
fixed size entries the switch need only track the number of entries in the
bucket rather than its virtual address. Assuming a max of 16 entries per bucket
this allows for only 4 bits per bucket of metadata on the switch. Given Tofinio
2 with 20 MB of SRAM this would allow the switch to handle inserts up to 640
million keys. If we were to allow buckets to become 255 entries deep and use 8
bits per bucket. The switch could support steering up to 40 billion end host
keys.

\textbf{Read optimizations} Because the index is append only, and the appends
happen in sequential memory, on search reads can be expanded to capture more of
the index. In the trivial case a read would be a single entry, if th entry is
not the one the client is searching for, it would move to the next like a
typical linked list. Here the client can expand it's read to capture more of the
index in a single round trip, if it is known that the index is loaded. Further
because the switch knows the load of each bucket it can resize the read to the
correct size (or location) to capture the index value it is searching for.

\subsection{Write Buffers} Write buffers operate similarly to the index. When a
write occurs it is allocated first by issuing a CAS with the size of the entry
to the end of the last write. If the CAS succeeds that write location is
allocated. A following write operation fills in the rest of the buffer with the
value, and the key of the actual write. The writes are self verifying, a CRC at
the end of the write demonstrates that it is successfully written. It is known
that CRCs are computationally expensive. One optimization would be to use
network hardware to insert the CRC in the network. A new write can complete
before a prior one has. An invalid write can be skipped over. Only the len is
essential for the correctness of the entry. Note that this approach requires
zeroed memory as following CAS operations must land zeros after the size denoted
by the writes len. A client could locate a write by iteratively reading the len
locations and hopping forward like a linked list. However because the data is
also sequential it is possible to read a large chunk of data which captures many
entries.

\textbf{performing a write} Writes, like inserts first require knowing the index
location. If a write has the index cached, it attempts to write to the end of
the known write list. If it has stale data, it's CAS allocate will fail and it
will proceed to read untill it finds the new tail of the write list. When a
successful cas occurs the writer then fills in the allocation with a write.
Finally the index is update to point to the new write location.

\textbf{batch operations} Colocated clients can batch their operations for
increased performance. When a CAS is issued to allocate a write, it can be
allocated for multiple entries simply by increasing the size of the len to
multiple entries. Once multiple entries have been written, the issuing client
can resize the len by issuing a second CAS to the same location but for the size
of only the first entry. To save this additional round trip a header bit could
be set on the CAS which indicates to the reader that the allocation contains
multiple entries. This way no round trip is required, and readers can
asynchronously read individual entries as soon as they complete.

\caption{ Unsafe index updates. Fetch-and-Add is used for pointer arithmetic
rather than an explicit pointer update. In the common case Fetch-and-Add adjusts
the pointer correctly. Under failures, or incorrect operation, CAS is a backup
option when inconsistencies occur. (Many corner cases are left as an exercise to
the reader.)}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Updating the index on writes} Traditionally an update to the index would
involve reading the old pointer location, then running a CAS(old,new). This same
operation is safe, and can be used to ensure the latest write is easy to find.
Note that we use the index pointer as a hint, and not as a definition of truth.
After locating an index, a concurrent write may make the index invalid.

\textbf{Unsafe index updates} For speed we could forgo using CAS and instead use
FAA. Because writes are sequential in memory, the len of the prior entry can be
FAA'd to the index pointer. This ensures that all index updates succeed because
FAA is associate and CAS is not. If concurrent writes result in two FAA being
delivered out of order the sum of the two will still be correct. Therefore the
index will eventually be correct. If a read occurs in an inconsistent state we
can use some sort of identifier in the write to know where the start and end of
entries are. If a client dies before performing an update. Another client can
always correct the index by reading the last entry, locking the writes, and then
fixing it with a CAS.
